# About Me

Hi! I'm **Zachary Plato**, a dedicated Software and DevOps Engineer with over 8 years of experience in developing high-performance applications, leading cross-functional teams, and driving innovation in cloud and microservices architecture.
Iâ€™m passionate about creating scalable solutions, mentoring fellow engineers, and working on projects that make a real-world impact. My experience spans backend development (Python, C++, Java), cloud technologies (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform), and building robust CI/CD pipelines.

In addition to my engineering career, I am a U.S. Army OEF Veteran and a continuous learner with an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.
